## <h1>Get to know me :</h1>
Being a Backend Developer with my favorite programming language being Java, i'm focusing on developing web projects. I always prioritize finding the optimal way to solve problems. I'm really interested in teamwork and collaboration because i can benefit from their real-world perspectives and contribute my own. Instead of focusing on competing with others, i would rather concentrate on improving every day.
